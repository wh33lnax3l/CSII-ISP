Dmg = Floor(.5 * Power * (Atk / Def) * Multipliers) + 1
Atk = (BaseAttack + AttackIV) * CPM
Def = (BaseDefense + DefenseIV) * CPM
CPM REFERS TO A TABLE, appproximate 0.1336 * level^.5

ALL MULTIPLIERS STACK MULTIPLICATIVELY (I think)
Multiplers: STAB, WAB, FAB, Effectiveness
STAB
- If move type is 1 of pokemon type, 1.2x

WAB
- If move type is a boosted weather type, 1.2x

FAB
- 3%, 5%, 7%, 10% depending on friendship tier

Effectiveness
- Move type against EACH defending type, no priority
- Neutral: 1.0x
- Super: 1.6x
- Not very: 0.625x
- Immune: 0.390625x (.0625 squared)
- Effectiveness stacks multiplicatively


DPS
- Calculate using damage formula, then cooldown and move duration for total time
- Cooldown? Need time between attacks as well as time for attack animation, unless they are not additive (ie. press button and CD starts immediately). Can't find easily, ask in Discord?
